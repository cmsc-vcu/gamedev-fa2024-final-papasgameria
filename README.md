## Game Description

The game is a psychological thriller visual novel set aboard a mysterious, eerie cruise ship. The player, John Bennet, is a man grappling with past trauma stemming from a horrific cave survival incident that led to fame and fortune through a best-selling book. The narrative focuses on themes of guilt, deception, and the psychological toll of unresolved trauma, interwoven with supernatural elements.

The player navigates Johnâ€™s interactions with other characters, including his wife Angelica, mysterious passengers, and an ominous figure referred to as "The Entity," while uncovering dark secrets about John's past and the sinister nature of the ship itself.
