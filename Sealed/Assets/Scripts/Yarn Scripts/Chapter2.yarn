My taste buds have never been the same. Not after what I had to do to survive. I do appreciate my wife trying to distract me and help me relax for once after my book tour, but it never feels like I am really relaxing; the memories never go away unless I keep myself busy.

    <<ChangeActorSprite John John-Neutral>>
John: I wasn't the only one to survive.
Adam: What? 
John: When I escaped the tunnel, I wasn't the only one that survived. Something else came back with me. Something dark and cruel, following me everywhere I go. No matter what I do, the press tours, the trips, spending time with my wife. Nothing stops it. 
    <<ChangeActorSprite John John-Angry>>
John: You said you taught psychology, right <i>professor</i>? Tell me what it is that keeps haunting me.
Adam: Well, the easy answer would be trauma. But, no. I don't think it's that. Trauma would not affect you the way you describe. This sounds more deeply rooted. This sounds like guilt. 
    <<ChangeActorSprite John John-Neutral>>
Adam: Guilt leaves a stain that you can never wash away, following you at your highs and lows in life. By why, why feel guilt when you've suffered so much. I wonder...
Adam: Could it be because you don't think your life was worth his or because... his sacrfice didn't mean anything. 
    <<ChangeActorSprite John John-Angry>>
John: Okay, that's enough questions. I appreciate your insights professor, but mind your own business. You want an autograph or something? 
Adam: Mr. Bennett right? Did he really sacrfice himself? Did he really place his life on the line for you? Or was it something else? 
John: If you really want to know the truth, he didn't sacrfice himself. He already died before I left. Died of starvation like the other soldiers, but because he was my closest friend I gave him an honorable end. There is that ending you really wanted. 
Adam: That would make more sense. But, I'm not sure. I did take a look at the autopsy report and it said that Arthur had bullet wounds. To the neck and chest. So which ending did he really have? The noble death, the starvation, or the event that gave you all this guilt.

You just want to tear it down, tear me down. John, you really have no compassion, can at least act like you're getting better?  
John: Getting better? You think taking me on a nice trip would make me forget? Forget everything that's happened? I will never forget and I don't want to. 
Angelica: Oh, you don't want to forget is that right? You've got to be kidding me. You think it's fun to wake up to you screaming in pain, screaming for it to go away. You really are a selfish person. You don't see how your pain affects those around you. I try to be a better wife to you and understand all of what you do, but you don't even try.
John: I'm not some broken toy that you need to fix. Any problem I've got, I can fix on my own. I go on your trips and give you everything I have, but you still complain that I give you nothing. How much more do you want from me? 
John: Do you want me to go on two hikes a week, take you shopping everyday, go to the bar with you every night? Look, I don't want much from you. I just want to spend time together at home, I dont get why you don't want the same.
Angelica: You know what? Arthur was right, you are a lazy man. Don't want to get up off your ass and do something with your life. Even before the incident, you didn't want anything to do with me. Arthur told me it's just who you are but I don't know if that justifies it. 
John: I don't like anything to do with you? I've given you the world, everything I have and despite what I've gone through, you say I do nothing. And keep Arthur's name out of your damn mouth. Even when he's dead, you like bringing him up like he's a saint. He did not live a perfect life, I would know. So, don't you dare compare me to him.
Angelica: You're right, you're not him. He was a better man than you. 
John: That's it. I'm going back to the room. You can find your way back. 
Angelica: Yeah, run away like you always do. I try get your mind off things by taking you on this once in a lifetime cruise, and you <i>ruin</i> it. Maybe this trip helped me learn something about you.
